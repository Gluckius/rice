## Css files for stylish. 
They can also be used for userChrome.css/userStyle.css.
* *xul.css* themes the Firefox UI.
* *about:newtab.css* themes the "speed dial" page in Firefox.
* For other files the name should tell you what does that file theme.
## Notes:
* To make my life easier I use a firefox theme called FT Deep Dark and use stylish to change some things. If you use the default theme or a different one, some stuff may not look as intended, because of different defaults.
* The xul style styles the interface but doesn't move stuff around. To do that, click with right mouse button on any toolbar and select "Customize". Then you can move stuff around. I have only the tabs toolbar enabled, I have tabs there and urlbar right of them.
