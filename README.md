See README files in different catalogs to learn what are the files in them for.
# Installation
Files can be installed automatically using `install` sh scripts.  Each subdirectory contains one such script, which when ran, will install the files from that subdirectory. There's also one in the main dir that will run all other, installing everything.
Install scripts use cp -pi to copy files, so they will ask to replace files (so it's safe to run).
Note there's no autmoatic installation script for stylish at the moment (one is in the works).
