## Miscellaneous files. 
This directory contains various miscellaneous files.

  * `fonts.conf` is a fontconfig configuration file, it sets default font rendering settings,
     some tweaks for certain fonts at certain sizes and aliases. I highly suggest to customize this.
     Note it's for vanilla fontconfig, not for infinality.
  * For others the name should suggest what the file's for.
